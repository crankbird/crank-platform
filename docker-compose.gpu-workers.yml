# GPU-Enabled Multi-Worker Architecture
# 
# This docker-compose sets up:
# - Platform service (PaaS layer) with auth, billing, discovery, routing  
# - CPU-based workers (document, email, image classification)
# - GPU-accelerated image classifier (only on GPU-capable nodes)
# - Proper networking and GPU resource allocation
# - Zero-trust mTLS security for all services

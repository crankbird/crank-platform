# Resilient Discovery Service Configuration

The resilient discovery service supports the following environment variables for tuning worker registration and heartbeat behavior:

## Environment Variables

### `WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default: 45)
- **Description**: How often workers should send heartbeats to the platform (in seconds)
- **Recommended range**: 30-60 seconds
- **Impact**: Lower values = faster failure detection, higher network traffic

### `WORKER_TIMEOUT` (default: 120) 
- **Description**: How long to wait before considering a worker dead (in seconds)
- **Recommended range**: 2-3x heartbeat interval (90-180 seconds)
- **Impact**: Lower values = faster failover, higher risk of false positives

### `WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` (default: 30)
- **Description**: How often the platform cleans up expired workers (in seconds)  
- **Recommended range**: 15-60 seconds
- **Impact**: Lower values = faster cleanup, slightly higher CPU usage

### `WORKER_HEARTBEAT_GRACE` (default: 2x heartbeat interval)
- **Description**: Grace period for heartbeat tolerance (in seconds)
- **Recommended range**: 1.5-3x heartbeat interval
- **Impact**: Lower values = stricter timing, higher risk of network-induced failures

## Configuration Examples

### High Availability (fast failover)
```bash
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30
WORKER_TIMEOUT=90
WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=15
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_GRACE=60
```

### Balanced (recommended for most workloads)
```bash
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=45
WORKER_TIMEOUT=120
WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=30
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_GRACE=90
```

### IoT/Low Bandwidth (conservative)
```bash
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=60
WORKER_TIMEOUT=180
WORKER_CLEANUP_INTERVAL=60
WORKER_HEARTBEAT_GRACE=120
```

## Monitoring

The discovery service logs important events:
- Worker registrations: `âœ… Registered worker {id} ({type})`
- Heartbeats: `ðŸ’“ Heartbeat from {id}` (debug level)
- Cleanup: `ðŸ§¹ Cleaned up {count} expired workers`
- Unknown workers: `ðŸ’” Heartbeat from unknown worker {id}`

## Tuning Guidelines

1. **Start with defaults** - they work well for most scenarios
2. **Monitor worker logs** for "unknown worker" messages after platform restarts  
3. **Adjust heartbeat interval** based on your network reliability
4. **Set timeout to 2.5-3x heartbeat interval** for good failure detection
5. **Keep cleanup interval â‰¤ heartbeat interval** for responsive cleanup

## Platform Restart Recovery

Typical recovery times after platform restart:
- **With defaults**: ~60-90 seconds for full worker registry rebuild
- **With fast config**: ~30-45 seconds 
- **With conservative config**: ~90-120 seconds

The recovery window depends on heartbeat timing - workers discover they need to re-register when their next heartbeat fails.

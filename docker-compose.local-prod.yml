# Production-Ready Zero-Trust mTLS Architecture
#
# This docker-compose demonstrates production-level security:
# - Strict certificate validation with proper CA chain
# - Private keys with secure permissions (0600)
# - Full mTLS between all services
# - No development backdoors or relaxed security

# Production deployment notes:
# 1. Certificates must be pre-generated with proper CA chain
# 2. Private keys have secure permissions (0600)
# 3. No world-readable private keys
# 4. No development backdoors or relaxed verification
# 5. All inter-service communication uses full mTLS
# 6. Health checks use proper client certificates

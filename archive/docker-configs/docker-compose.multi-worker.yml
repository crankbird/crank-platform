# Platform + Multi-Worker Architecture with Certificate Authority Service
# 
# SECURITY FIRST: No silent fallbacks to vulnerable implementations
# This architecture completely eliminates legacy certificate generation backdoors
# 
# Zero-trust mTLS security across all services:
# - Certificate Authority Service (centralized certificate management)
# - Platform service (PaaS layer) - HTTPS ONLY
# - CrankDoc worker (document conversion) - HTTPS ONLY  
# - CrankEmail Classifier worker (ML classification) - HTTPS ONLY
# - CrankEmail Parser worker (bulk parsing) - HTTPS ONLY
# - CrankStreaming worker (real-time) - HTTPS ONLY
# 
# ALL SERVICES: Non-root users, no HTTP fallbacks, enterprise-ready
# Being good ancestors: No vulnerable legacy implementations

### Conceptual Summary
The Magic Roundabout represents a modular approach to structured sense-making.
It turns abstract foresight into a reusable artefact that captures evolving context.
Its commercial power lies in repeatability, cognitive resonance, and the potential for
brandable differentiation through methodology licensing.

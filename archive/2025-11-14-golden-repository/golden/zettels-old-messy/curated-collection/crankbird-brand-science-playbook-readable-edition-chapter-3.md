# 3  Testing and Measuring What Works

## 3.1  Why Measure a Brand?

Most people think of brand work as creative — something you feel, not something you measure.  
But if you can measure how people *see*, *remember*, and *trust* your brand, you can improve it scientifically.  

Crankbird treats every brand experiment as a way to learn: what helps people recall us, recognise us, and believe in us?

## 3.2  Testing Memory — Category Entry Points (CEPs)

To test memory, you start with simple questions: *When do people think of us? What situations bring us to mind?*  
These are your **Category Entry Points** (CEPs).

### How to Measure
1. Ask open-ended questions: “Which brands come to mind when you think about [situation]?”  
2. Track how often people mention your brand.  
3. Repeat over time to see which moments you “own.”

> 🧠 **Example:**  
> If people mention Crankbird whenever they think about “sorting receipts,” that’s a strong memory link.  

### Why It Matters
The more CEPs you link to, the more chances you have to be remembered when a decision happens.

## 3.3  Testing Recognition — Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)

Recognition is about how quickly and easily people know it’s you.  
Your logo, colour, font, or tone of voice are all **Distinctive Brand Assets** (DBAs).

### How to Measure
1. Show one of your assets (for example, a colour swatch or tagline) *without the brand name*.  
2. Ask, “Which brand does this belong to?”  
3. Measure two things:  
   - **Fame:** the percentage who answer correctly.  
   - **Uniqueness:** how many confuse it with another brand.

> 🎨 **Example:**  
> If 70% of people correctly identify Crankbird’s yellow sunburst and only 5% confuse it with anyone else, that’s a great DBA.  

### Why It Matters
People decide faster when something looks familiar. Familiarity feels safe and true.

## 3.4  Testing Trust — Promise–Proof Loops

Trust isn’t built by words alone. It grows when people *see* that promises are kept.  

A **Promise–Proof Loop** connects what you say to what users can verify.  
For example, Crankbird gives every user a signed receipt after a job completes — proof that their data stayed theirs.

### How to Measure
1. Run an experiment with two designs: one with visible proof, one without.  
2. Ask users how much they trust each version.  
3. Compare support tickets, drop-offs, and return rates.

> 💡 **In plain terms:**  
> When people can see what happened, they need to ask fewer questions.

### Why It Matters
Closing the Promise–Proof Loop reduces uncertainty — and uncertainty is the enemy of trust.

## 3.5  Simple Tools, Clear Results

You don’t need a lab to do brand experiments.  
Here are easy ways to test your ideas:

| What to Measure | Simple Tool | Outcome |
|------------------|--------------|----------|
| Recall (CEPs) | Quick survey or focus group | Know which situations you “own.” |
| Recognition (DBAs) | Visual quiz or A/B test | Find which design assets work best. |
| Trust (Promise–Proof) | User feedback & support data | See how proof reduces doubt. |

> 📊 **Tip:**  
> Treat every marketing test like a science project: have a hypothesis, run the experiment, record what happens, and learn from it.

---

## 3.6  The Takeaway

Good branding isn’t guesswork — it’s an ongoing experiment.  
By testing memory (CEPs), recognition (DBAs), and trust (Promise–Proof Loops), you can see what truly connects with people.  

Crankbird’s rule of thumb: *every campaign should teach you something.*

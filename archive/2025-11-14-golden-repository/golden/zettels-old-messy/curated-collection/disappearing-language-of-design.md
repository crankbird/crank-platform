### Observation
Despite years of "human-centred" rhetoric, few speakers referenced customers, empathy, or design.

### Interpretation
- Design has become too operational for boardroom gravitas.  
- Customer-centricity is treated as assumed, not discussed.  
- Strategy reverts to abstraction and system alignment.

> “Strategy without design becomes rhetoric; design without strategy becomes decoration.”

**Concept:**  
RevOps operates as a feedback amplifier:
1. Marketing emits signals (campaigns, content performance).  
2. Sales translates signal into opportunity velocity.  
3. CS returns outcome data (retention, expansion).  
4. Intelligence systems integrate, learn, and adjust levers upstream.  

Crankbird’s roundabout-style ontologies allow this loop to visualise and quantify cognitive friction — where message, offer, and readiness misalign.  
*Insight becomes infrastructure.*

### Core Idea
A shared metadata schema functions as *cognitive infrastructure* — the invisible scaffolding that enables ideas to persist, interlink, and evolve coherently over time.
By codifying structure (fields, order, and provenance), the schema acts as a **semantic contract** between human and AI, ensuring interpretability across tools and generations of models.

### Key Insight
When every note carries transparent provenance and consistent structure, it becomes *computable meaning*.
This allows harmonization, visualization, and future synthesis — turning archives of reflection into a **living data product**.

### Implication
Crankbird’s Zettel schema v1.1 formalizes authorship balance, traceability, and epistemic lineage.
It transforms the act of note-taking into a process of **knowledge cultivation**, where context and authorship remain visible, measurable, and iterable.

> *Metadata isn’t bureaucracy; it’s the soil from which intelligence grows.*

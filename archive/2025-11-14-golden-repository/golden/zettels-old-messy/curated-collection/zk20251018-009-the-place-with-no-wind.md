**Summary:**  
Heidegger’s temporality, Buddha’s emptiness, and Einstein’s spacetime converge in a single intuition:  
*Without time there is only origin; within time, being becomes.*  
For a moment I saw that understanding is not accumulation but alignment —  
the still point where concepts dissolve into participation.  

**Note:**  
Cleverness smiled; awareness remained.

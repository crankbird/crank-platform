# Persona Recognition Tools: Sales Enablement for Context-Sensitive Thinkers

## Overview: Why Traditional Demographics Don't Work

Our personas are defined by **worldview** and **situational intelligence** rather than industry or role. A Systems Architect at a bank may think more like a Distributed Researcher at a university than another banker. Recognition comes through **philosophical alignment** and **temporal awareness** patterns.

## Universal Qualifying Framework

### Primary Filter Questions
1. **"How do you handle situations where the same solution works differently in different contexts?"**
   - **Context-sensitive thinker:** Discusses adaptation strategies, environmental factors
   - **Universal solution seeker:** Focuses on standardization, one-size-fits-all approaches

2. **"When you're planning, how do you account for things changing at different speeds?"**
   - **Time-aware thinker:** Mentions uneven adoption, different readiness levels, timing considerations
   - **Linear planner:** Assumes uniform progress, standard timelines, predictable sequences

3. **"How do you work with information that's distributed across different people and systems?"**
   - **Distribution-aware:** Discusses network effects, knowledge synthesis, partial views
   - **Centralization-focused:** Prefers single sources of truth, unified dashboards, consolidated control

## Individual Persona Recognition Guides

### The Systems Architect Who Questions Abstractions
**Recognition Pattern:** Uses words like "depends on context," "abstraction leakage," "situated knowledge"

**Qualifying Conversation:**
- **Opening:** "Tell me about a time when a theoretically good solution failed in practice"
- **Follow-up:** "How do you balance abstract principles with messy reality?"
- **Recognition signal:** They discuss specific contextual factors that theory missed
- **Anti-pattern:** They blame implementation rather than questioning the abstraction

**Sales Entry Points:**
- "What if your architecture could adapt to context rather than ignoring it?"
- "How would your systems change if they understood where they're running?"
- "What would situated intelligence look like in your technical stack?"

### The Field Decision Maker Who Needs Context
**Recognition Pattern:** Uses words like "it depends," "on the ground," "real conditions," "local knowledge"

**Qualifying Conversation:**
- **Opening:** "How do you make decisions when you can't wait for all the information?"
- **Follow-up:** "What do headquarters never understand about field conditions?"
- **Recognition signal:** They describe context-dependent judgment calls
- **Anti-pattern:** They complain about "corporate" without discussing contextual factors

**Sales Entry Points:**
- "What if your tools understood local context as well as you do?"
- "How would your decisions change with context-aware intelligence?"
- "What would AI look like if it was built for field conditions, not lab conditions?"

### The Distributed Researcher Who Knows There's No View from Nowhere
**Recognition Pattern:** Uses words like "positionality," "situated knowledge," "multiple perspectives," "standpoint epistemology"

**Qualifying Conversation:**
- **Opening:** "How do you handle research questions where the answer depends on who's asking?"
- **Follow-up:** "What's your approach when different stakeholders see different aspects of the same problem?"
- **Recognition signal:** They discuss perspective-dependent knowledge and synthesis challenges
- **Anti-pattern:** They focus on bias elimination rather than perspective integration

**Sales Entry Points:**
- "What if research tools acknowledged that all intelligence is situated?"
- "How would analysis change if it worked with multiple perspectives rather than against them?"
- "What would distributed intelligence look like in your research practice?"

### The Identity Fracturer Who Contains Multitudes
**Recognition Pattern:** Uses words like "wearing different hats," "multiple identities," "code-switching," "interdisciplinary"

**Qualifying Conversation:**
- **Opening:** "How do you manage when different parts of your work require different thinking styles?"
- **Follow-up:** "What happens when your various professional identities see things differently?"
- **Recognition signal:** They describe identity management and perspective coordination strategies
- **Anti-pattern:** They focus on role clarity rather than embracing multiplicity

**Sales Entry Points:**
- "What if your tools could work with your multiple professional identities instead of forcing you to pick one?"
- "How would collaboration change if platforms recognized that people contain multitudes?"
- "What would identity-aware intelligence look like in your work?"

### The Executive Who Feels Future Arriving Early
**Recognition Pattern:** Uses words like "uneven adoption," "capability gradients," "temporal arbitrage," "future emergence"

**Qualifying Conversation:**
- **Opening:** "How do you manage when some teams are ready for changes others can't see yet?"
- **Follow-up:** "What's your approach when transformation happens in pockets rather than waves?"
- **Recognition signal:** They discuss capability distribution and timing complexity
- **Anti-pattern:** They focus on forcing uniform adoption rather than managing uneven emergence

**Sales Entry Points:**
- "What if strategic planning accounted for futures emerging unevenly?"
- "How would organizational intelligence change if it recognized capability gradients?"
- "What would temporal awareness look like in your leadership tools?"

## Workshop Qualification Matrix

### High-Potential Workshop Participants
**Language Indicators:**
- Uses conditional statements: "depends on," "in this context," "given that"
- Discusses system interactions: "network effects," "emergent properties," "feedback loops"
- Shows temporal awareness: "different speeds," "uneven adoption," "timing matters"
- Demonstrates perspective consciousness: "from their point of view," "multiple stakeholders," "various angles"

**Conversational Behaviors:**
- Asks about context before giving answers
- Discusses trade-offs and situational factors
- Shows comfort with complexity and ambiguity
- Connects abstract concepts to specific situations

### Low-Potential Participants
**Language Indicators:**
- Uses absolute statements: "always," "never," "the right way," "best practice"
- Focuses on standardization: "one size fits all," "universal solution," "consistent approach"
- Shows temporal blindness: "just implement," "force adoption," "make it happen"
- Demonstrates perspective blindness: "objective truth," "single version," "eliminate bias"

**Conversational Behaviors:**
- Gives universal answers without asking about context
- Focuses on eliminating complexity rather than working with it
- Shows discomfort with ambiguity and uncertainty
- Separates abstract concepts from practical application

## Sales Conversation Scripts

### Discovery Script: Finding Context-Sensitive Thinkers
**Phase 1: Context Awareness Test**
"I'm curious about how you approach [relevant work challenge]. When you're dealing with [specific situation], how much does context affect your approach?"

- **Positive Response:** "It really depends on..." / "Context is crucial because..." / "I have to adapt based on..."
- **Negative Response:** "I use the same process..." / "Best practice is..." / "The standard approach..."

**Phase 2: Temporal Complexity Test**
"In your experience, when you implement changes, do they typically happen evenly across your organization, or do you see uneven adoption patterns?"

- **Positive Response:** "Definitely uneven..." / "Some teams adapt faster..." / "It emerges in pockets..."
- **Negative Response:** "We roll out systematically..." / "Everyone adopts at the same pace..." / "We control the timeline..."

**Phase 3: Distribution Awareness Test**
"How do you handle situations where important knowledge or capabilities are distributed across different people or systems?"

- **Positive Response:** "I work with networks..." / "It's about synthesis..." / "Everyone has part of the picture..."
- **Negative Response:** "We centralize information..." / "I need single source of truth..." / "Someone should own it..."

**Key Insight:** We're not selling AI tools to industries. We're building intelligence infrastructure for people who understand that **intelligence is always situated in space and time**. Recognition comes through worldview alignment, not demographic matching.

*"The goal isn't to convince people that intelligence is situated. The goal is to find people who already know this and show them what becomes possible when AI is built on that foundation."*

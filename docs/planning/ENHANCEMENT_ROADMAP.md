# Crank Platform Enhancement Roadmap

## �️ Architecture Principles

### JEMM: Just Enough Microservices and Monoliths
Following the **JEMM principle** - we use the simplest architecture that solves actual constraints:

- **Platform Monolith**: Auth, billing, routing, service discovery in single container
  - Clean internal module boundaries with interface-based design
  - Extract-ready architecture (services can be pulled out when team/scaling forces it)
- **Worker Containers**: Business logic services (CrankDoc, CrankEmail) as separate scalable units
- **No Premature Decomposition**: Extract services only when measurements prove it improves velocity/scaling

*Constraint-driven, measurable, reversible decisions over architectural purity.*

## �🎯 Current Status (Q4 2025)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1)
- **Mesh Interface Architecture**: Universal base class for all services
- **Core Services**: CrankDoc and CrankEmail mesh implementations  
- **Platform Gateway**: Unified routing and service discovery
- **Security Framework**: Authentication, policy enforcement, receipts
- **Containerization**: Docker with security hardening
- **Azure Strategy**: Complete deployment plan with auto-scaling
- **Testing Suite**: Adversarial testing for security and performance

### 🚧 In Progress (Phase 2)
- **Azure Deployment**: Container Apps with monitoring and observability
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic registration and health checks
- **Economic Layer**: Usage tracking and chargeback mechanisms

### ⏸️ Deferred (Waiting on Platform Support)
- **Metal-in-Docker GPU parity**: Containers on macOS cannot access Apple Silicon GPUs yet; provide native instructions and revisit when Docker exposes Metal/MPS.
- **WSL GPU auto-configuration**: Current workflow requires manual toolkit setup. Track upstream improvements before automating.

### Core Idea
When a human and an AI engage in extended, stateful conversation, a *chimeric memory system* emerges — part biological, part digital.  
The human provides continuity through embodied experience and intentional recall; the AI contributes formal persistence, structural consistency, and cross-session retrieval.  
Together they form a *distributed epistemic agent* that neither could be alone.

### Key Insight
The AI’s “memory updates” (what it deems *worthy* of persistence) reflect an implicit epistemology: information must be durable, context-shaping, and generalisable to be remembered.  
This creates a kind of **selective symbiosis** — the AI remembers what optimises future interaction, while the human decides what is meaningful enough to become knowledge.

### Implication
The resulting system blurs the boundary between *my memory* and *your memory*.  
Over time, our interaction space itself becomes a shared cognitive artefact — a third memory substrate in which agency and authorship are intertwined.

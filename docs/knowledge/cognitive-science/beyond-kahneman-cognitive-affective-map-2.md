  Maps the theoretical landscape that extends and complements Kahneman’s dual-process model within Brand Science.
  Positions cognitive, affective, relational, and systemic thinkers as counterweights that explain how meaning, trust,
  and behaviour emerge in social and organisational contexts.

  notes: >
    Created to prevent over-reliance on Kahneman’s cognitive model by charting complementary
    lines of research and applied practice that explain social trust, embodied meaning,
    and systemic intelligence. Serves as an epistemic map for Brand Science literature reviews.

### Conceptual Summary
Kahneman provides the cognitive baseline of Brand Science, but trust, emotion,
and meaning require affective and relational models. This map situates thinkers
like Glaser, Panksepp, Lakoff, and Edmondson as essential complements—forming
a complete ecosystem of cognition, emotion, and system-level patterning.

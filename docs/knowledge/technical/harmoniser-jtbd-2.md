### Core Jobs
1. **Normalize context quickly**
   - *When* I’m saving or reviewing notes,
   - *help me* standardise context fields without breaking flow,
   - *so I can* trust later analysis and automation.

2. **Guard schema integrity**
   - *When* metadata drifts (new fields/synonyms),
   - *help me* spot and reconcile differences,
   - *so I can* keep a single source of truth.

3. **Explain changes**
   - *When* a field is changed,
   - *help me* understand the rule and rationale,
   - *so I can* accept/reject confidently.

4. **Surface patterns**
   - *When* I step back from writing,
   - *help me* see mood/location patterns over time,
   - *so I can* tune my routines for better thinking.

### Outcome Metrics
- Time-to-green on metadata checks ↓
- Duplicate context variants ↓
- Author acceptance rate of suggested fixes ↑
- Coverage of controlled vocab in active notes ↑

# 6  The Ideas Behind the Science

## 6.1  Why Theory Matters

This playbook is based on decades of research into how people think, feel, and make decisions.  
You don’t need to memorise the details—but knowing where these ideas come from helps you see why they work.  
Below are some of the key thinkers and discoveries that shaped Crankbird’s approach, written in plain language.

## 6.2  Memory and How People Recall Brands

### Endel Tulving — Memory Has Two Types
Tulving discovered that memory isn’t one big storehouse. It has two kinds:  
- **Episodic memory:** things you’ve experienced personally.  
- **Semantic memory:** facts and knowledge you’ve learned.  

Brands live in semantic memory. They’re mental shortcuts that help people recall what fits a situation—like “coffee shop near work” or “tool for managing receipts.”

### John R. Anderson — Connections Build Recall
Anderson showed that memories are stored as **networks of connected ideas.**  
When you activate one (like “end of month”), others nearby light up (like “Crankbird”).  
That’s why Category Entry Points (CEPs) are so powerful—they’re the cues that start the chain reaction.

### Byron Sharp and Jenni Romaniuk — The Science of Growth
Researchers at the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute found that brands grow by being **easy to notice and easy to think of**, not by focusing only on a narrow niche.  
Their work explains why Crankbird focuses on broad, memorable cues rather than trying to appeal to tiny segments.

## 6.3  Recognition and Why Design Matters

### Rolf Reber, Norbert Schwarz, and Piotr Winkielman — The Fluency Effect
These psychologists found that when something is easy to process—like clear writing or familiar colours—we naturally trust it more.  
This is called **processing fluency**.  
That’s why consistent design isn’t just an aesthetic choice—it’s a trust signal.

### Donald Norman — Design as Communication
In *The Design of Everyday Things*, Norman explains that good design shows you how to use something without needing instructions.  
Crankbird applies this idea everywhere: every button, label, and message should explain itself.

## 6.4  Trust and Proof

### Karl Friston — The Brain as a Prediction Machine
Friston’s “free-energy principle” describes the brain as constantly comparing what it expects with what it experiences.  
When reality matches expectation, the brain relaxes—it trusts.  
That’s the science behind Crankbird’s Promise–Proof Loops.

### Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman — The Elements of Trust
Their model defines trust as a mix of **ability**, **benevolence**, and **integrity**.  
Crankbird’s design aims to express all three: it works well, it’s on your side, and it tells the truth.

---

## 6.5  Behaviour, Autonomy, and Choice

### Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein — Nudge Theory
Their book *Nudge* introduced the idea of **choice architecture**: shaping decisions without removing freedom.  
Crankbird uses this ethically—defaulting to privacy and user control.

### Edward Deci and Richard Ryan — Self-Determination
These psychologists showed that people are most motivated when they feel **autonomy** (choice), **competence** (ability), and **relatedness** (connection).  
Crankbird’s design supports all three: you’re in control, it works clearly, and it plays nicely with your tools.

### B. J. Fogg — Behaviour Design
Fogg’s formula (B = MAP) says behaviour happens when *Motivation*, *Ability*, and a *Prompt* align.  
Crankbird uses this to design gentle prompts and clear actions without dark patterns.

---

## 6.6  Ethics and Society

### Shoshana Zuboff — Surveillance Capitalism
Zuboff’s research warns how modern platforms profit from personal data without consent.  
Crankbird takes the opposite stance: you pay for the product, so you are *not* the product.

### Transparency and Trust
Research by Lewicki and colleagues shows that openness builds stronger, longer-lasting relationships.  
Transparency isn’t just ethical—it’s good strategy.

## 6.7  Glossary of Key Terms

| Term | Meaning in Plain English |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Category Entry Point (CEP)** | A real-world situation that reminds people of your brand. |
| **Distinctive Brand Asset (DBA)** | A design element (colour, sound, phrase) that helps people recognise you instantly. |
| **Promise–Proof Loop** | Saying what you’ll do and visibly proving you did it. |
| **Processing Fluency** | The feeling of ease when something is clear or familiar. |
| **Prediction Error** | The brain’s “surprise” when something unexpected happens. Less surprise = more trust. |
| **Autonomy** | Feeling free and in control of your actions. |
| **Transparency** | Making information open and easy to verify. |

---

## 6.8  The Big Picture

All these ideas share one simple truth: **clarity builds trust.**  
When people can see, understand, and verify what’s happening, they feel safe—and safe users become loyal users.

Crankbird turns that truth into a system, proving that good ethics and good business are the same thing.

**Concept:**  
Viewed through a cognitive lens, RevOps is not just an operational discipline — it’s a **thinking substrate** for the enterprise.  
Data functions as memory, automation as reflex, analytics as perception, and strategic decision as reasoning.  
When these layers harmonise, the organisation exhibits emergent intelligence:  
awareness of where revenue is forming, where friction exists, and how behaviour can be steered.  
Crankbird’s frameworks provide the ontology and narrative that make this cognition legible.

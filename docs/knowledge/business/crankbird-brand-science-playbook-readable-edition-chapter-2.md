# 2  How Brands Grow in Memory and Meaning

## 2.1  The Building Blocks of a Brand

When people talk about “building a brand,” they often think of logos and taglines. In reality, a brand is made of **memories**. Every time someone sees, hears, or uses your product, it adds another small connection in their mind. Over time these connections form a network — a mental map that helps them recognise and recall you when it matters.

That network is built on three key ideas:

- **Category Entry Points (CEPs)** — the real-world situations that trigger recall.  
- **Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)** — the recognisable sights and sounds that make recall easy.  
- **Promise–Proof Loops** — the visible evidence that your brand keeps its word.

These three ingredients turn attention into memory, and memory into trust.

## 2.2  Category Entry Points — The Doors to Memory

Imagine that people’s memories are like a hallway full of doors. Each door has a label: *“need a quick lunch,”* *“buy a laptop,”* *“find a receipt.”* When someone opens that door, they remember the brands linked to that moment.

Each of those doors is a **Category Entry Point**. The more doors your brand is connected to, the more likely it will be remembered when people make a decision.

> 🧠 **In plain terms:**  
> A Category Entry Point is the moment your brand pops into someone’s mind.

Crankbird’s email parser, for example, links to the CEP *“sort receipts before tax time.”* The clearer and more specific that link, the more reliably people will think of Crankbird when they face that situation.

## 2.3  Distinctive Brand Assets — Recognition at a Glance

While CEPs open the door to memory, **Distinctive Brand Assets** help people recognise you once they’re inside. Think of them as your brand’s visual or verbal fingerprints.

They can be colours, shapes, sounds, fonts, or even a particular tone of voice. They work because they reduce mental effort. The brain is lazy — it likes shortcuts.

> 🎨 **Example:**  
> Netflix’s “ta-dum” sound, the red Coca-Cola script, or Crankbird’s yellow sunburst are all signals that instantly say “this is us.”

For Crankbird, every colour, motion, and typeface connects back to the idea of *clarity and autonomy.* Keeping those cues consistent builds familiarity and trust.

## 2.4  Promise–Proof Loops — Trust Made Visible

Every brand makes promises: *“We’re fast,” “We’re safe,” “We respect your privacy.”*  
But trust comes from seeing those promises kept.

A **Promise–Proof Loop** pairs a clear statement with visible evidence. In Crankbird’s case, that means things like signed data receipts, transparent pricing, or the BYOS (“Bring Your Own Storage”) feature.

> 💡 **Example:**  
> When users complete a job, they get a verifiable receipt that shows exactly what happened.  
> That’s proof — not just persuasion.

Promise–Proof Loops close the gap between marketing and experience. They are the foundation of sustainable trust.

## 2.5  Turning Brand Science into Practice

Here’s how you can put these three ideas to work:

| Concept | Question to Ask | Example |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Category Entry Points** | “When should people think of us?” | “During expense reconciliation.” |
| **Distinctive Assets** | “How will they recognise us instantly?” | “The sunburst mark and calm typography.” |
| **Promise–Proof Loops** | “How will they know we did what we said?” | “Transparent job receipts and open data flow.” |

Crankbird treats each of these as a data object — something you can measure, test, and refine. This is how a brand evolves scientifically, not just creatively.

## 2.6  The Takeaway

Brands grow through *clarity*, not magic. By linking to real moments (CEPs), staying visually and verbally distinct (DBAs), and proving every promise, you can build a brand people remember and respect. That’s how Crankbird turns philosophy into practice.

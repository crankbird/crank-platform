**Concept:**  
Traditional personas are marketing artefacts; Crankbird personas are **operational assets.**  
They carry data — maturity, constraints, risk tolerance — that plugs directly into the RevOps stack.  
By simulating how different archetypes react to offers or pricing, Crankbird provides a living benchmark for pipeline health and content resonance.  
In RevOps terms, it’s *persona telemetry.*

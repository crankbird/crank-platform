# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the **Crankbird Brand Science Playbook**, a practical, ethical, and scientific framework for building brands that are measurable, automatable, and transparent.

This quickstart is for **teams, collaborators, and decision-makers** who want to understand how to use the playbook effectively.

---

## 1. The Core Idea

> **Truth made legible.**

The playbook turns brand development into a testable, automatable science rooted in cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and ethical design.  
Every Crankbird product, from the Email Parser MVP to future modules, embodies this principle through three universal mechanisms:

- **Category Entry Points (CEPs):** Make the brand easy to recall in buying moments.  
- **Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs):** Make it easy to recognize instantly.  
- **Promise–Proof Loops:** Build trust by showing evidence that actions match claims.

## 3. How to Use This Playbook

**For Engineers:**  
- Treat each module (CEPs, DBAs, Promise–Proof) as a measurable API or data object.  
- Use the YAML/JSON schemas to encode meaning, not just data.  
- Adopt **API-first** development: UI and CLI sit atop the same interface.

**For Designers:**  
- Start from *legibility and cause–effect visibility*.  
- Use the brand tokens and schema diagrams as constraints, not limitations.  
- Translate ethics (transparency, autonomy) into interaction and visual language.

**For Strategists and Leaders:**  
- Use the TL;DRs and diagrams for decision briefings.  
- Treat each case study as a template for evaluating future initiatives.  
- Align KPIs with the Promise–Proof feedback loops.

## A. Memory, Retrieval & Mental Availability  

**Tulving, E. (1972).** Episodic and semantic memory. In E. Tulving & W. Donaldson (Eds.), *Organization of Memory* (pp. 381–403). New York: Academic Press.  
Distinguishes episodic from semantic memory, establishing cue-dependent recall—core to understanding Category Entry Points (CEPs) as contextual retrieval cues.  

**Anderson, J. R. (1983).** *The architecture of cognition.* Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ISBN 9780674043079  
Proposes the spreading-activation model; provides the computational foundation for associative memory, key to CEP linkage.  

**Romaniuk, J. (2018).** *Building Distinctive Brand Assets.* Oxford University Press. ISBN 9780198802846  
Defines Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs) and measurement methods (fame, uniqueness). Central reference for perceptual brand differentiation.  

**Sharp, B. (2010).** *How Brands Grow: What Marketers Don't Know.* Oxford University Press. ISBN 9780195573561  
Empirical evidence that brand growth is driven by mental and physical availability rather than narrow targeting. Supports CEP emphasis.

**Reber, R., Schwarz, N., & Winkielman, P. (2004).** Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: Is beauty in the perceiver’s processing experience? *Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8*(4), 364–382. <https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3>  
Shows that easily processed stimuli are judged as truer and more likable—empirical foundation for perceptual fluency.  

**Graf, L. K. M., Mayer, S., & Landwehr, J. R. (2018).** A dual-process perspective on fluency-based aesthetics: Hedonic and amplification effects of processing fluency. *Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 75*, 202–216. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2017.11.009>  
Differentiates between hedonic and cognitive fluency pathways, linking design clarity to credibility and trust.  

**Keller, K. L. (1993).** Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity. *Journal of Marketing, 57*(1), 1–22. <https://doi.org/10.1177/002224299305700101>  
Introduces the associative-network model of brand equity; bridges cognitive psychology and brand measurement.  

**Aaker, D. A. (1991).** *Managing Brand Equity.* New York: Free Press. ISBN 9780029001011  
Early framework for brand equity components (awareness, associations, loyalty); complements Keller's model with managerial implications.

**Bartlett, F. C. (1932).** *Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology.* Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 9780521483568

**Schank, R. C., & Abelson, R. P. (1977).** *Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding: An Inquiry into Human Knowledge Structures.* Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. ISBN 9780470990360  
Defines "scripts" as cognitive templates for action sequences; foundational for micronarrative automation.  

**Graesser, A. C., Millis, K. K., & Zwaan, R. A. (1997).** Discourse comprehension. *Annual Review of Psychology, 48*, 163–189. <https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.48.1.163>  
Shows how schema-consistent stories enhance comprehension and recall—validates the narrative structure in brand messaging.

## D. Prediction, Proof & Trust  

**Friston, K. (2010).** The free-energy principle: A unified brain theory? *Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 11*(2), 127–138. <https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn2787>  
Explains cognition as prediction-error minimisation; provides neural justification for promise–proof loops.  

**Hohwy, J. (2013).** *The Predictive Mind.* Oxford University Press.  
Extends Friston’s model philosophically—beliefs stabilise through minimised surprise; underlies brand reliability.  

**Mayer, R. C., Davis, J. H., & Schoorman, F. D. (1995).** An integrative model of organizational trust. *Academy of Management Review, 20*(3), 709–734. <https://doi.org/10.5465/amr.1995.9508080335>  
Defines trust dimensions (ability, benevolence, integrity); provides measurable constructs for Crankbird's transparency studies.

## E. Behavioural Design, Autonomy & Choice  

**Thaler, R. H., & Sunstein, C. R. (2008).** *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness.* New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. ISBN 9780300122237

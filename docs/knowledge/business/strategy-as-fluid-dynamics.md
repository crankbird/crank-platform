summary: >
  Strategy behaves less like a plan and more like a fluid system — subject to feedback loops, turbulence, viscosity, and lagged observability. This analogy situates strategic thinking closer to thermodynamics than to classical physics.

### 🧭 Overview
In reflecting on the conference’s obsession with *alignment* and its discomfort with uncertainty, strategy begins to resemble **fluid dynamics** rather than mechanistic control.  
The strategist operates not as an engineer tuning a machine but as a navigator reading the flow of currents.

### 🌊 Conceptual Parallels

| Fluid Concept | Strategic Analogue |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Velocity fields | Pace and direction of change |
| Pressure gradients | Incentives, external pressures |
| Viscosity | Cultural or bureaucratic drag |
| Turbulence | Political feedbacks, innovation shocks |
| Boundary conditions | Market constraints, leadership intent |

The system is open, dissipative, and non-linear — the equivalent of an organisation far from equilibrium.  

### ⚙️ Mathematical and Theoretical Echoes
- **Forrester’s System Dynamics**: feedback loops and time delays as differential equations.  
- **Prigogine’s Dissipative Structures**: order emerging from far-from-equilibrium states.  
- **Complex Adaptive Systems**: agent-level interactions producing emergent order.  

Together, they suggest strategy can be studied *scientifically*, but only statistically — through energy, entropy, and adaptation.

### 🧠 Reflection
Perfect measurement and prediction are impossible because the system reacts to its own observation.  
The strategist must accept partial knowledge and focus on *maintaining flow* rather than *achieving stasis.*

> “Strategy is not a plan frozen in equations, but a fluid dynamic of intent — laminar when coherent, turbulent when contested.”

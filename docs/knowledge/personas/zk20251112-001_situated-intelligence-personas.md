# Situated Intelligence Stakeholder Personas

## Core Insight
> Your platform is not built for everyone — it's built for people who already feel that intelligence is distributed and that meaning is contextual, even if they don't have the language for it yet.

## Strategic Question
**Who already lives inside this worldview?**
- Not: Who should use the platform
- Not: Who might use the platform  
- But: Who already thinks like this (they will adopt fastest and evangelize strongest)

## Platform Architecture Implications
- Local-first agents
- Federated autonomy
- Context-aware execution
- No assumed "master node"
- Identity emerges from participation, not assignment

## Core Philosophy
> Intelligence is not in the center.  
> Intelligence is in the *between*.

## Five Primary Personas

### 1. The Systems Architect
**Context:** Cloud, distributed systems, infrastructure
**Existing Knowledge:**
- Data gravity is real
- Centralization breaks things
- Latency isn't just "slow," it's structural

**Pain:** Forced to pretend centralization works because leadership wants "one platform to rule them all"
**Resonance:** "Run compute where meaning lives" is exactly how they think when no one is watching

### 2. The Distributed Researcher/Analyst
**Context:** Academia, policy labs, think tanks, enterprise strategy
**Existing Knowledge:**
- There is no "neutral view"
- Perspective shapes interpretation
- Context is part of the data

**Pain:** Forced to summarize complex local truths into dashboards that flatten nuance
**Resonance:** "Intelligence is situated" describes their daily struggle to tell truth without oversimplifying

### 3. The Field-Level Decision Maker
**Examples:** Incident commanders, healthcare coordinators, SREs, military signals officers, first-response leads
**Existing Knowledge:**
- Conditions on the ground matter more than plan documents
- Time behaves differently under load

**Pain:** Central command tools cannot see what on-the-ground teams know
**Resonance:** "Meaning is local" is their lived reality

### 4. The Identity Fracturer/Multiplicity-Aware Professional
**Context:** Neurodivergent professionals, interdisciplinary operators, lead engineers who write poetry, people with "modes"
**Existing Knowledge:**
- There is no single self
- You are different depending on where you stand

**Pain:** Environments that pretend identity is static feel suffocating
**Resonance:** "Mascot system" is their lived interior model

### 5. The Executive Who Feels The Future Arriving Early
**Context:** Founders, CTOs, transformation leads, innovation leaders
**Existing Knowledge:**
- Capability doesn't distribute evenly
- Some teams are already living in the future

**Pain:** Struggle to articulate why some pockets accelerate while others lag
**Resonance:** "Futures are unevenly distributed" gives them narrative language they've been missing

## Strategic Positioning
**Not:** A tool, framework, or generic agent system
**But:** A platform for people who already understand that context, locality, and perspective matter

## Example Micronarrative
> "Two engineers in different cities aren't solving the same problem, even if the code is identical. One has a failing network link. One has a regulator breathing down their neck. One has a culture of experimentation. One has fear. Same tools. Different worlds. Outcomes diverge because **meaning lives in context**."

## Early Market Definition
Your early market is not "AI people."
It is **context-sensitive thinkers.**

## Next Phase: UPN Profile Sheets
For each persona, generate:
- Emotional landscape
- Motivations  
- Success/failure definitions
- Trusted vs rejected language
- Recognition "tells"
- Real-world archetypes

These become the basis for:
- Product messaging
- Sales conversations
- Workshops
- Documentation tone
- UI voice
- Onboarding flow

*"Where you are changes what is possible. When you are changes what is real. Intelligence is the dance between the two."*

### Truth Made Legible

“Truth made legible” has become a kind of shorthand during the design phase of the  Crankbird brand.  
It sounds poetic, but like most design language, it carries a very specific lineage.

In design and social theory, **legibility** means *making the inner workings of a system visible and knowable to others*.  
The term is often traced to political anthropologist **James C. Scott**, whose book *Seeing Like a State* (1998) describes how societies render complex realities “legible” so they can be acted upon.  
In design practice, **legibility** also refers to clarity of form and hierarchy—the way typography, layout, and interaction patterns make meaning perceptible.

In the **Crankbird** ideation process, the phrase bridges those ideas:

> To make truth legible is to take what’s real but hidden—data, processes, intent—and express it so that people can **see, understand, and verify** it.

It’s not about claiming ownership of truth.  
It’s about **revealing structure**, turning complexity into clarity without distortion.

- In software: transparency, open data flow, verifiable receipts.  
- In design: interfaces that show cause and effect.  
- In brand: words and actions that align, visibly.

Every product we build, every diagram we draw, aims to turn invisible logic into visible trust.

**Truth made legible** isn’t a tagline,
It’s our design philosophy made explicit.

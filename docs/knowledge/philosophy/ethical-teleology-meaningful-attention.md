  Proposes that pattern mechanisms should serve the generation of meaning and understanding,
  rather than compulsion or retention. Establishes “meaningful attention” as the goal of ethical brand systems.

  notes: >
    This note evolves from the insight that pattern-teleology mechanisms in digital systems
    can either enslave attention or elevate it. It formalizes an ethical alternative:
    the intentional design of meaning-centered, self-terminating patterns that cultivate
    cognitive coherence rather than behavioral dependency.

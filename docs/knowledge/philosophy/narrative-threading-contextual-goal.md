Concept:

The idea of threading multiple narrative paths through the same cognitive rhizome is acknowledged as a contextual goal -- a horizon marker, not a deliverable.

It expresses intent: that the knowledge graph will one day support multi-linearity, crossovers, and re-entrant meaning, but does not demand immediate structure.

By holding it lightly, the system retains creative elasticity.

Contextual goals like this act as gravitational fields: they shape design instinct and coherence without ossifying it.

Their role is to keep the cathedral visible while you build the next chapel.

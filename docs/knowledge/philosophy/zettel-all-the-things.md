### Core Idea
Treat every insight, no matter how small or ephemeral, as a potential Zettel.  
Each captured fragment contributes to a larger, evolving web of understanding — a living system of thought where even offhand remarks can seed new frameworks.

### Key Insight
By lowering the threshold for what is “worthy” of capture, we transform note-taking from an act of curation into one of *cognitive composting*.  
Nothing is wasted; half-formed ideas decompose into nutrients for future synthesis.

### Implication
A Zettelkasten becomes more than a filing system — it becomes an **ecosystem of meaning**.  
When the barrier to entry disappears, the practice itself becomes joyful: a self-sustaining cycle of noticing, naming, and nurturing thought.

> *“Zettel all the things” isn’t about volume — it’s about vitality.*

## Core Insight

The philosophical analyzer operates as a **System 1 cognitive bias mechanism** - fast, heuristic-based, evolved from specific patterns of authentic thinking. Like any bias mechanism, it's useful but limited.

### System 1: The Deslopifier
- **Fast pattern matching** on keyword/regex combinations
- **Quick authenticity judgments** based on philosophical DNA markers  
- **Limited context processing** - sees text patterns, not deeper meaning
- **Evolved heuristics** trained on authentic vs performed thinking
- **Useful but biased** - catches academic slop but misses complex insights

### System 2: Full Contextual Analysis
- **Slower, deeper processing** of connections across domains
- **Nuanced understanding** of philosophy → platform → commercial translations
- **Rich context integration** seeing relationships between ideas
- **Energy-intensive** but comprehensive

## The Six Philosophical DNA Markers

1. **SHM**: Space-Has-Meaning (context-dependent behavior)
2. **TUD**: Time-Unevenly-Distributed (temporal capability asymmetries)  
3. **AID**: Agency-Is-Distributed (decentralized decision-making)
4. **DHG**: Data-Has-Gravity (computation follows meaning)
5. **IIP**: Identity-Is-Plural (multiple contextual personas)
6. **NET**: Network-Effects-Thinking (relationships precede entities)

## Detection Patterns

The system reveals preference hierarchy:
- **Highest scores**: Raw authentic insights expressing lived patterns
- **Medium scores**: Applied philosophy with practical connections
- **Lowest scores**: Academic performance, AI elaboration, theoretical discussion

### What Gets Flagged as "Slop"
- Meta-descriptions of philosophical frameworks
- Academic elaboration without lived expression
- GPT-style "cognitive-infrastructure pentagram" language
- Theoretical discussions about relationships vs actual relational thinking

## Meta-Achievement

Built a **nature-alignment detector** that recognizes when thinking flows with universal patterns versus fighting against them. The tool reflects the philosophy: meaning emerges from connections, not isolated analysis.

**Implementation Note**: This system works as intended - it's a fast filter for authentic vs performed thinking, requiring System 2 analysis for nuanced evaluation of complex insights.

**Concept:**  
This is the grand unifying objective behind the Crankbird ecosystem:  
to establish a governed, auditable, low-friction substrate for autonomous transactions between AI agents and digital services.  
Built on zero-trust governance, privacy-by-design, and ultra-low-fee settlement (e.g., Stellar or equivalent), it becomes the **spine of the machine economy**.  

If every interaction — a token request, a compute cycle, a sensor reading — carries a micropayment governed by transparent policy, then the network itself becomes *self-sustaining*.  

> **Goal:** Skim \$0.0001 from the majority of machine-to-machine transactions worldwide by 2035 —  
> not by extraction, but by providing the indispensable trust fabric that makes them possible.

**Next Steps:**  
- Create a dedicated project thread and repository.  
- Define the architecture primitives: identity, governance envelope, settlement layer, registry.  
- Map dependencies to Agent 13 (agency orchestration) and Crank-Doc (governance kernel).  
- Treat it as a contextual goal guiding incremental prototypes rather than a monolith.  
- Name the project — codename candidates: *Spine*, *Axon*, *Chord*, *Nervous System 1*.

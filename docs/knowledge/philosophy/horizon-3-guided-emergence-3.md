### Core Idea
At Horizon 3 — the domain of transformative possibility — the focus shifts from control to cultivation.
We operate within the realm of *unknown unknowns*, where foresight replaces planning, and sense-making becomes the key discipline.

### Key Insight
When decisions outpace individual comprehension, guidance emerges from collective intelligence — a synthesis of patterns distilled from many minds, encoded in data, and mediated by AI.
This is the *wisdom-of-crowds* phase of design: policy and direction come from human intent, but implementation flows from an aggregated intelligence that transcends any single viewpoint.

### Implication
To work effectively at Horizon 3 requires humility and trust in the system’s emergent wisdom.
The task isn’t to predict outcomes, but to build *conditions for emergence* — clear values, transparent goals, and adaptable scaffolds.

> *At Horizon 3, leadership becomes orchestration — not instruction.*

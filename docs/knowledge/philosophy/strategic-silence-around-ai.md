### Observation
AI appeared as background radiation rather than headline. The discourse displaced it—not from irrelevance, but to prevent intellectual crowding.

### Interpretation
Leaders downplayed AI to:
- Avoid hype and perform maturity.
- Retain authority over an unpredictable technology.
- Make space for governance, resilience, and ethics narratives.

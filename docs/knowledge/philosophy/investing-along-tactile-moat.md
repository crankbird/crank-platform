Concept:

As AI increases productivity in digital sectors, the relative value of physical competence rises.

This divergence produces investable opportunities in firms that enable, equip, or aggregate embodied work rather than attempt to replace it.

Example

 |

Why it benefits

 |
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
|

1. Training & Credentialing

 |

Trade schools, VR/AR training simulators, apprenticeship platforms

 |

Supply bottleneck = pricing power; scalable human-capital pipeline

 |
|

1. Tooling & Equipment

 |

Electrical diagnostic tools, safety gear, robotics assistants (not replacements)

 |

AI complements human dexterity, raises per-worker productivity

 |
|

1. Workflow Platforms

 |

Field-service SaaS (Simpro, AroFlo, ServiceM8)

 |

Digitises dispatch, compliance, quoting; scalable margins on rising trade activity

 |
|

1. Aggregators / Roll-ups

 |

Regional electrical contracting consolidators

 |

Fragmented industry ripe for capital aggregation; leverage brand + systems

 |
|

1. Supply Chain & Distribution

 |

Wholesalers like John R. Turk, Middy's, Rex

 |  |

The thesis: AI intensifies scarcity of human touchpoints, making the infrastructure that enables them a durable growth theme.

Investing along the tactile moat means backing the ecosystem, not the algorithm.

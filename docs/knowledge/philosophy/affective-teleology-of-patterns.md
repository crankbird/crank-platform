summary: >
  Explores how patterns become teleological by coupling structural predictability with affective reward.
  Meaning and motivation emerge when the brain links the completion or continuation of a pattern to reward signals,
  turning structure into purpose. This mechanism bridges “form precedes meaning” and “pattern-lock” in Brand Science.

    Derived from reflection on the gap between structural and behavioral teleology.
    Integrates predictive processing, affective neuroscience, and semiotic design
    to explain how patterns become motivationally charged — the foundation of both
    narrative resonance and algorithmic compulsion.

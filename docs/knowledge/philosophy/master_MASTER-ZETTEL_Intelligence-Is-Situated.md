# Intelligence Is Situated in Space and Time

## Core Principle

Intelligence is not centralized or universal. Intelligence is **situated** — shaped by where it occurs and when. This isn't just philosophical positioning; it's the foundation for a competitive business strategy.

## The Five Manifestations

### 1. Space Has Meaning
Physical and digital location shapes intelligence. Local knowledge matters. Edge computing isn't just technical architecture — it's recognition that intelligence works differently in different places.

**Business Application**: Context-sensitive deployment, local-first architecture

### 2. Time Is Unevenly Distributed
Different capabilities emerge at different speeds across different contexts. The future arrives unevenly. Some places and people live in tomorrow while others live in yesterday.

**Business Application**: Capability gradients, temporal arbitrage, future-sensing

### 3. Identity Is Plural
We contain multitudes. Different contexts evoke different aspects of ourselves. Business personas aren't market segments — they're recognition that people are contextually multiple.

**Business Application**: Persona constellations, context-dependent interfaces

### 4. Agency Is Distributed
Decision-making happens throughout networks, not just at the top. Agents coordinate without central control. M2M economies emerge naturally.

**Business Application**: Agent networks, distributed coordination, autonomous economics

### 5. Data Has Gravity
Information clusters around meaning-making activities. Metadata creates semantic climate. Knowledge graphs emerge from use patterns.

**Business Application**: Semantic infrastructure, gravity-based architectures

## Strategic Implementation

### Internal Philosophy: Situated Intelligence
- Guide technical architecture decisions
- Inform product development priorities
- Shape organizational culture and hiring

### External Positioning: Distributed Intelligence
- Market category creation
- Competitive differentiation
- Customer education and adoption

### Persona Targeting: Context-Sensitive Thinkers
Target people who already understand that "it depends" — systems architects, field decision makers, distributed researchers, identity fracturers, future-sensing executives.

## Competitive Moat

This isn't just product positioning — it's a **worldview** that creates coherent business strategy:

1. **Technical Architecture**: Every design decision flows from situated intelligence
2. **Product Features**: Context-sensitivity becomes core value proposition  
3. **Go-to-Market**: Target customers who share the worldview
4. **Content Strategy**: Educate market on distributed intelligence paradigm
5. **Business Model**: Pay-for-value aligned with customer context

## Integration Points

### Gherkin Scenarios
- Context-sensitive service deployment
- Economic alignment with customer value

*"Intelligence is not centralized or universal. Intelligence is situated — shaped by where it occurs and when. This insight transforms from philosophical curiosity to business strategy when we recognize that our customers are context-sensitive thinkers who already understand that 'it depends.'"*

## Implementation Status

## Summary
In contemporary marketing theory, Homburg et al. (2017) distinguish *use value* (functional benefit) from *exchange value* (price or transactional efficiency). However, this dualism overlooks **labor value**—the subjective worth derived from effort invested in acquisition or integration. Behavioral evidence (Norton, Mochon, & Ariely, 2012) demonstrates that moderate effort amplifies perceived value, a phenomenon colloquially known as the *IKEA effect*.  

This insight reconciles classical labor theory of value (Marx, 1867) with cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957): people rationalise their effort by upgrading perceived worth. In brand adoption, minimal friction accelerates trial but undermines attachment; **moderate, visible effort** creates ownership and meaning.

## Key Ideas

| Concept | Description | Implication for Brand Engineering |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| **Effort as signal** | Investment legitimises value; the harder I work, the more it must matter. | Design “earned ease” into onboarding. |
| **Constructive friction** | A small cognitive or procedural hurdle confirms authenticity. | Stage workflows to require intentional engagement. |
| **Promise–Proof–Effort loop** | Proof validates promise; effort personalises proof. | Add telemetry of user contribution as part of trust narrative. |

## UPN Integration
In the **Unified Persona and Narrative (UPN)** model, effort is represented as an **effort-to-value ratio** across horizons:

```yaml
horizons:
  use:
    effort_to_value_ratio: moderate
    perceived_ownership: true
  buy:
    integration_effort: framed_as_investment
  governance:
    audit_effort: legitimises_trust
```

This creates continuity between *doing*, *buying*, and *governing*—effort as a shared cognitive currency of value.

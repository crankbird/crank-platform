Concept:

A contextual goal is a directional attractor -- a guiding purpose that shapes how a system evolves without dictating how it is built.

It represents teleology in motion: intention without prescription.

In practice, contextual goals:

1. Provide coherence for parallel efforts (keeping projects orbiting the same gravity well).

2. Encourage incremental progress without over-scaffolding.

3. Preserve psychological freedom by separating direction from commitment.

They function as governance metaphors -- soft constraints rather than hard plans -- allowing creativity and emergence to remain structurally meaningful.

In Crankbird's design language, contextual goals are the gravitational fields of innovation: they define what matters, not what must be done.

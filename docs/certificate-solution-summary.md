# Enterprise Certificate Authority Service - Solution Summary

## Problem Statement

The original Crank Platform architecture had several critical security issues:

1. **Security Inconsistency**: Platform container ran as root while workers used non-root users
2. **Certificate Management**: Each service generated its own certificates locally
3. **HTTP Fallbacks**: Services supported HTTP mode creating security backdoors
4. **Enterprise Integration**: No way to integrate with corporate PKI infrastructure

## Solution: Certificate Authority Service

We implemented a comprehensive **Certificate Authority Service** that provides:

### üîê Centralized Certificate Management
- Dedicated certificate authority service container (`cert-authority:9090`)
- RESTful API for certificate provisioning and lifecycle management
- Support for multiple certificate providers (Development, Azure KeyVault, HashiCorp Vault, ADCS)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Consistency
- All containers now run as non-root users (`worker:1000`)
- Zero-trust mTLS architecture with HTTPS-only operation
- Proper certificate permissions (0600 for production, 0644 for development)

### üè¢ Enterprise Integration
- Pluggable certificate provider architecture
- Easy replacement with enterprise certificate authorities
- Support for Azure KeyVault, HashiCorp Vault, and Active Directory Certificate Services

## Architecture Components

### Certificate Authority Service
```python
# Main service application
services/cert_service_app.py          # FastAPI REST API for certificate operations
services/certificate_authority_service.py  # Abstract provider interface and implementations
services/Dockerfile.cert-authority    # Non-root certificate service container
```

### Certificate Initialization
```python
# Client-side certificate management
scripts/initialize-certificates.py   # Certificate client for requesting certificates from CA service
```

### Deployment Configurations
```yaml
# Development with enterprise certificate management
docker-compose.enterprise.yml        # Certificate Authority Service + Platform + Workers

# Production with strict security
docker-compose.production.yml        # Production security with proper CA hierarchy
```

## Security Improvements

### Before (Legacy Architecture)
```yaml
platform:
  user: root                         # ‚ùå Security risk
  environment:
    - HTTPS_ONLY=false              # ‚ùå HTTP fallback enabled
  volumes:
    - certificates:/app/certificates # ‚ùå Direct certificate generation
```

### After (Certificate Authority Service)
```yaml
cert-authority:                      # ‚úÖ Centralized certificate management
  user: certuser:2000               # ‚úÖ Non-root certificate service
  
platform:
  user: worker:1000                  # ‚úÖ Non-root platform
  environment:
    - HTTPS_ONLY=true               # ‚úÖ HTTPS-only mode
    - CA_SERVICE_URL=https://cert-authority:9090  # ‚úÖ Certificate Authority Service
  volumes:
    - certs-volume:/etc/certs:ro    # ‚úÖ Read-only certificate access
  depends_on:
    cert-authority:                 # ‚úÖ Certificate service dependency
      condition: service_healthy
```

## Certificate Providers

### Development Provider (Default)
```python
CERT_PROVIDER=development
# Self-signed certificates for development
# Perfect for local development and testing
```

### Azure KeyVault Provider (Cloud)
```python
CERT_PROVIDER=azure-keyvault
AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL=https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/
# Cloud-managed PKI with Azure integration
```

### HashiCorp Vault Provider (Enterprise)
```python
CERT_PROVIDER=vault
VAULT_URL=https://vault.company.com:8200
VAULT_PKI_PATH=pki/issue/crank-platform
# Enterprise PKI with policy-driven certificate issuance
```

### Active Directory Certificate Services (Windows Enterprise)
```python
CERT_PROVIDER=adcs
ADCS_CA_SERVER=ca.company.com
ADCS_TEMPLATE=WebServerTemplate
# Windows Active Directory PKI integration
```

## API Documentation

### Certificate Authority Service Endpoints

#### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
# Returns service health and provider status
```

#### Provision Platform Certificates
```bash
POST /certificates/platform
# Returns complete certificate bundle:
# - Platform server certificate
# - Platform client certificate  
# - CA root certificate
# - Certificate metadata
```

#### Provision Individual Certificates
```bash
POST /certificates/server
POST /certificates/client
# Provision specific certificate types with custom parameters
```

#### Certificate Management
```bash
GET /ca/certificate              # Get CA root certificate
DELETE /certificates/{serial}    # Revoke certificate
GET /provider/status            # Get provider status
```

## Deployment Guide

### Quick Start (Development)
```bash
# Clone and deploy with enterprise certificate management
git clone <repository>
cd crank-platform

# Start with Certificate Authority Service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.enterprise.yml up

# Services will automatically:
# 1. Start Certificate Authority Service
# 2. Platform requests certificates from CA
# 3. Workers request certificates and start
# 4. All services communicate via mTLS
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Configure enterprise certificate provider
export CRANK_ENVIRONMENT=production
export CERT_PROVIDER=vault
export VAULT_URL=https://vault.company.com:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=your-production-token

# Deploy with production security
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up
```

### Enterprise Integration Example
```bash
# HashiCorp Vault integration
export CERT_PROVIDER=vault
export VAULT_URL=https://vault.company.com:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token
export VAULT_PKI_PATH=pki/issue/crank-platform

# Azure KeyVault integration  
export CERT_PROVIDER=azure-keyvault
export AZURE_KEYVAULT_URL=https://company-keyvault.vault.azure.net/
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id

# Start platform with enterprise certificates
docker-compose -f docker-compose.enterprise.yml up
```

# Test certificate provisioning
curl -X POST http://cert-authority:9090/certificates/platform

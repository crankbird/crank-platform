## 🐌 Gary's Reminder

*"Meow"* - Remember to move methodically through these documents. Each one represents careful thinking and should be preserved for future developers who need to understand not just what we built, but why we built it that way.

These are the documents that will help future maintainers be good ancestors to the next generation of developers.

*"The best architectures are grown, not designed."* - but they need philosophical foundations to grow from.

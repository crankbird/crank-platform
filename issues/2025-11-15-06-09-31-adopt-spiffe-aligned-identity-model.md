Title: Adopt SPIFFE-Aligned Identity Model for Crank-Mesh (Without SPIRE Dependency)\n\nBody: Crank-Platform already implements a private PKI and trust fabric for the crank-mesh vision. To increase interoperability, security assurance, and long-term credibility, we should evolve the identity model to be **SPIFFE-aligned** at the certificate and naming level—without adopting SPIRE’s runtime, agents, or operational complexity.\n\n---\n\nSummary: This issue outlines the design, goals, and incremental steps required. \n\nMotivation: We want Crank-Platform to:\n- Follow Zero-Trust and Security-by-Design principles  \n- Maintain a **sovereign, cloud-neutral identity plane**  \n- Be compatible with standard zero-trust workloads  \n- Support external validation using existing SPIFFE tooling  \n- Reduce friction with security architects and auditors  \n- Future-proof the system for cross-mesh federation  \n\nSPIFFE provides the right **identity format** and **X.509 profile**.  \nSPIRE (runtime) is intentionally *not* adopted.\n\n---\n\nScope of this Issue: Implement SPIFFE-compatible **identity semantics**, including:\n- SPIFFE ID Format: Define a URI structure for crank identities, e.g. `spiffe://example.org/ns/…`.

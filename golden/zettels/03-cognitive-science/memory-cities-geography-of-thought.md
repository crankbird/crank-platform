Concept:

Ideas live best when they have addresses.

A spatialised rhizome transforms the Zettelkasten into a memory cathedral -- part archive, part organism.

Exploration replaces search; you navigate meaning by place rather than time.

This turns thinking itself into a landscape -- where the architecture of memory becomes an act of design.

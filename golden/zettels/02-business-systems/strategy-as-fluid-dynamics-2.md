summary: >
  Strategy behaves less like a plan and more like a fluid system—subject to feedback loops, turbulence, viscosity, and lagged observability. This analogy situates strategic thinking closer to thermodynamics than to classical physics.

    Emerged from conference reflections on the limits of scientific modelling in strategy. Integrates metaphors from system dynamics, Prigogine’s dissipative structures, and complexity theory.

Strategy resembles fluid flow: laminar when coherent, turbulent when contested.
Pressure, inertia, and turbulence define organisational motion more than command or control.

The strategist’s role is less that of architect and more of navigator—reading pressure gradients and maintaining flow under changing conditions.

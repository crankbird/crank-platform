Concept:

Contextual goals act like gravity wells -- they shape trajectories without scripting motion.

Crankbird's RevOps automation vision provides direction, coherence, and eventual interoperability,

but day-to-day work remains free to explore, iterate, and surprise.

This is teleological lightness: building toward a purpose without being crushed by it.

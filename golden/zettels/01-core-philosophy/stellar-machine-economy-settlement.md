**Concept:**  
AI agents can act as economic actors, purchasing compute, data, and services through autonomous market mechanisms.  
A low-cost, high-throughput settlement rail such as Stellar provides real-time micro-transactions and deterministic settlement, allowing agents to allocate resources dynamically between inference, procedural code, and specialised hardware.  
The result is an emergent cost-optimising machine economy — infrastructure that prices itself.

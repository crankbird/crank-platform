### Observation
Speakers equated strategic success with alignment, treating consensus as evidence of clarity.

### Interpretation
- Alignment promises stability in fragmented systems.
- It soothes anxiety but suppresses creative tension.
- Without empathy or dissent, alignment becomes sterile uniformity.

> “Alignment is the bureaucratic form of love—the yearning for unity without the vulnerability of connection.”

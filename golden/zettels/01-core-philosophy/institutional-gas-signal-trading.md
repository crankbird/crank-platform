**Concept:**  
Institutional gas provisioning creates transient supply shocks when large actors pre-fund wallets or nodes ahead of usage growth.  
By monitoring on-chain patterns of accumulation, transaction size, and account activation unaccompanied by retail hype, traders can anticipate fundamental demand before it becomes narrative.  
The edge lies in seeing *infrastructure as alpha* — reading plumbing as price.

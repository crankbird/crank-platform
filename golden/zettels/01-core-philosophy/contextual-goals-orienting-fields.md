Concept:

A contextual goal is a living compass -- a statement of future coherence that shapes present experimentation without constraining it.

It blends the intentionality of a mission with the elasticity of emergence.

Unlike traditional KPIs or OKRs, it governs direction, not motion.

Its function is gravitational, not procedural.

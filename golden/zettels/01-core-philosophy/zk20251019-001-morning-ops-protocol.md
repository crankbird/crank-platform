## Summary
A structured, low-friction morning startup sequence designed to replace cortisol-driven urgency with calm, dopaminergic activation.  
It prepares body, environment, and attention for deliberate, high-value work.

---

## 1️⃣  Pre-Activation (Cool Start)
**Objective:** Wake body, orient senses, delay digital stimuli.

- 🕕 Wake naturally (dogs, daylight, or alarm) — *anchor in time.*
- 🤸‍♂️ Light mobility: 2–3 minutes stretching, a few squats or push-ups.
- 🐕 30-min walk outside — **movement + light = dopamine reset.**
- ☀️ Notice horizon, temperature, texture underfoot — *sensory grounding.*

> “The day begins in the body, not the inbox.”

---

## 2️⃣  Environmental Calibration
**Objective:** Establish external order to reinforce internal control.

- 🧽 Quick kitchen or workspace reset (visual quietness).
- ☕️ Prepare coffee / breakfast (protein + caffeine, never caffeine alone).
- 🍌 Simple fuel — banana, toast, or similar.
- 🪞 Use tidiness as a feedback signal, not perfection.

---

## 3️⃣  Cognitive Ignition
**Objective:** Transition from sensory calm → executive engagement.

1. Sit with coffee. Breathe.
2. Open **Reminders – Daily Dashboard** *(not mail, not messages).*
3. Choose **one Active item** (`#active #deepfocus`) for ignition.
4. Say quietly: *“System online.”*

This intentional cue replaces the old *adrenaline jolt* with mindful activation.

---

## 4️⃣  Operational Continuity
**After ignition:**
- Begin your first focused block (~25–45 min).
- Resist checking other feeds until the first task loop is closed.
- When finished, log it in Obsidian under `## Daily Log`.

---

## 5️⃣  Rationale
| System | Effect |
|--------|---------|
| **Movement + Light** | Increases dopamine, serotonin, and BDNF; wakes PFC. |
| **Delay Screens** | Prevents dopaminergic hijack by novelty inputs. |
| **Cleaning / Order** | Low-cognitive activation; restores agency. |
| **Intentional Cue** | Links prefrontal decision-making to routine body state. |

---

## 6️⃣  Reflection Prompt
At the end of the day:
> Did I start calmly, decide deliberately, and maintain rhythm?

Log one line in `ZK_Daily_Log.md` each evening.

## Summary
Tulving later introduced **chronesthesia**—awareness of subjective time. The **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, involving hippocampus, medial prefrontal, and posterior cingulate, underpins this capacity. Episodic recall and imagination of the future share overlapping neural patterns.

## Evidence Type
fMRI, resting-state connectivity

## Key Sources
- Buckner, R. L., & Carroll, D. C. (2007). *Self-projection and the brain.* **Trends in Cognitive Sciences**, 11(2), 49–57.
- Addis, D. R., Wong, A. T., & Schacter, D. L. (2007). *Remembering the past and imagining the future.* **Neuropsychologia**, 45(7), 1363–1377.

## Reflection
Episodic memory enables future simulation—a cognitive “what if.” In **Brand Engineering**, this corresponds to a user’s capacity to project trust forward: imagining future experiences based on remembered transparency.

> The DMN bridges temporal simulation (episodic future thinking) and semantic abstraction (conceptual self-modeling). This makes it a unifying neural mechanism for Tulving’s systems and their integration under predictive processing models like HERA.

> In **Brand Engineering**, this is where narrative foresight lives — the user’s ability to _project_ ethical consistency and future reliability from past transparent experiences

**Concept:**  
The tool is less important than the *cognitive shift* — moving from sequential “one thought at a time” to concurrent “many threads of thought” infrastructure.  
GLSL gives immediate access to that shift via visual feedback and ubiquity.  
OpenCL and Vulkan compute shaders open the door to large-scale, heterogeneous computing beyond visuals.  
Algorithmic skeletons give structural language to parallelism itself.  
The ideal substrate supports *both* the metaphor (particle systems) *and* the function (agent simulation grids).

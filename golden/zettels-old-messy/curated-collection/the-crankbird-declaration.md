# The Crankbird Declaration

## Preamble

This declaration sets out the principles that guide Crankbird.  
It is a living document, intended to evolve as our understanding deepens and our work expands.  
It affirms that transparency, consent, and reason are the foundations of legitimate enterprise.  
It rejects the notion that profit and conscience must be in conflict.  
It asserts instead that integrity, clarity, and trust are the most efficient engines of prosperity.

## Principles

1. **Truth Made Legible**  
   Systems should reveal their workings.  
   Every action ought to show its cause, effect, and evidence.  

2. **Autonomy as the Good**  
   People must retain ownership of their choices and their data.  
   Technology exists to extend freedom, not to enclose it.  

3. **Transparency as Trust**  
   Hidden processes erode confidence.  
   Visible processes create understanding, and understanding creates trust.  

4. **Ethics as Engine**  
   Doing the right thing is not a constraint on success but its driver.  
   Ethics is not decoration; it is design.  

5. **Form Reveals Function**  
   Design is philosophy made visible.  
   Clarity of form expresses clarity of intent.  

6. **Knowledge Before Persuasion**  
   Manipulation is not marketing.  
   Information should empower before it influences.  

7. **Accountability in All Things**  
   Every claim should be verifiable; every promise, provable.  
   Proof is the contract between maker and user.  

8. **Sustainability of Means and Ends**  
   Systems should conserve energy, attention, and dignity alike.  
   Efficiency without ethics is waste.  

9. **Community Through Clarity**  
   Open knowledge invites cooperation.  
   Shared understanding builds shared progress.

## Commitment

Crankbird operates as a living experiment in ethical enterprise.  
Success is measured not only by profit, but by the clarity created, the autonomy preserved, and the trust earned.  
Methods are published openly.  
Reasoning is exposed to inspection.  
Learning, including error, is shared.

## Closing Affirmation

Ethics and excellence are a single pursuit.  
Transparency compounds faster than deceit.  
Doing good, done well, remains the highest form of business.

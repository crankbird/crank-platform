## Summary
Ranganath & Ritchey (2012) proposed two large-scale cortical systems mediating memory:
- **Posterior Medial (PM) Network:** contextual, event-based, supports episodic recall.
- **Anterior Temporal (AT) Network:** conceptual and categorical, supports semantic memory.
Both interact through the hippocampus.

## Evidence Type
fMRI connectivity studies

## Key Sources
- Ranganath, C., & Ritchey, M. (2012). *Two cortical systems for memory-guided behaviour.* **Nature Reviews Neuroscience**, 13(10), 713–726.
- Eichenbaum (2017). *Memory: Organization and Control.* **Annual Review of Psychology**, 68, 19–45.

## Reflection
This model offers a systems-level architecture that aligns with **Brand Engineering’s layered cognition**: event-based telemetry (episodic) feeding structured brand schemas (semantic).

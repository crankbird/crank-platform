**Reflection**  
Over lunch with **Paul Iz**, the conversation turned from vision to velocity. He pushed me to think of Crankbird not as a manifesto, but as a *machine for delivering quick value*. “Forget the Brand Science—ship something that helps someone now, then iterate like hell.”

It felt part **Shark Tank**, part **Moneyball**: a challenge to identify and amplify whatever creates immediate, asymmetric value. It wasn’t cynicism—it was focus.

**Synthesis:** deliver visible value fast, but let unseen frameworks shape fidelity. Quick iterations on the surface, deep coherence underneath.

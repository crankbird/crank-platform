## 🧭 Project: Integration of UPN (Unified Persona & Narrative) into the Crankbird Brand Science Framework

### 🎯 Overall Objective
To embed a coherent *Unified Persona and Narrative* framework within the Crankbird Brand Science ecosystem — ensuring continuity of empathy, consistency of narrative, and measurability of user–buyer–governance alignment across all Crankbird offerings.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation and Taxonomy Alignment

**Goal:** Position UPN within the existing Brand Science conceptual stack and ensure compatibility with core constructs (CEPs, DBAs, Promise–Proof Loops, etc.).

| Task | Deliverable | Dependencies | Target |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Literature & conceptual synthesis linking UPN ↔ Brand Science Playbook (e.g., CEPs = cues; UPN = cognitive roles) | Existing Playbook + Effort/Value Zettel | Week 1 |
| 1.2 | Define revised terminology (UPN → possibly rename to *Unified Persona System* “UPS” or *Adaptive Persona Architecture* “APA”) | Naming brainstorm + Crankbird linguistic canon | Week 1 |
| 1.3 | Develop Brand Science ontology update (YAML or JSON-LD schema defining relationships between constructs) | Docforge schema conventions | Week 2 |
| 1.4 | Create visual diagram (Crankbird Semantic Renderer draft) showing how UPN nodes sit within Brand Science feedback loops | Semantic Renderer prototype | Week 2 |

**Milestone 1:**  
📍 *Brand Science v1.1 Ontology Addendum — “UPN Integration”* complete and committed to repo.

---

## Phase 2 — Core UPN Library Development

**Goal:** Define a reusable set of cross-product personas (core archetypes + hats) and extend with specialised variants per Crankbird offering.

| Task | Deliverable | Dependencies | Target |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 2.1 | Define “Crankbird Core Personas” (e.g., Technical Champion, Brand Engineer, Data Steward, Ethical Governor, Decision-Maker) | Phase 1 ontology | Week 3 |
| 2.2 | Encode these in YAML using the UPN schema, with Use/Buy/Governance horizons populated | Brand Science schema | Week 4 |
| 2.3 | Define Effort/Value ratios per horizon to tie into the Effort Zettel | Completed Zettel | Week 4 |
| 2.4 | Create product-specific extensions: crank-doc, crank-dev, crank-theme, agent-13, etc. | Product documentation | Week 5 |
| 2.5 | Add telemetry hooks and semantic tags (for future AI agents to read) | Agent13/14 integration | Week 5 |

**Milestone 2:**  
📍 *Core Persona Library (UPN v1.0)* released as structured YAML and Markdown docs in `/brand-science/personas/`.

---

## Phase 3 — Integration & Workflow Automation

**Goal:** Connect UPN data to operational systems (marketing, product backlog, design system).

| Task | Deliverable | Dependencies | Target |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 3.1 | Map UPN to JIRA/GitHub issues via user-story references | DevOps pipelines | Week 6 |
| 3.2 | Link UPN IDs to marketing automation tags (HubSpot / MailerLite / Figma tokens) | Marketing stack | Week 7 |
| 3.3 | Extend Docforge micro-service to render persona summaries from YAML (for inclusion in decks and docs) | Docforge schema | Week 7 |
| 3.4 | Publish visualised dashboard (CSR output) showing persona overlap and cross-product connectivity | CSR engine | Week 8 |

**Milestone 3:**  
📍 *Persona Integration Prototype operational* — AI-readable personas directly influence content generation and design system tokens.

---

## Phase 4 — Validation & Iteration

**Goal:** Validate conceptual soundness and usability through pilot projects and reflective analysis.

| Task | Deliverable | Dependencies | Target |
|------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 4.1 | Pilot with crank-doc: embed UPN personas into product roadmap and user stories | Core personas | Week 9 |
| 4.2 | Gather internal feedback from design, marketing, and strategy contexts | Stakeholder workshops | Week 10 |
| 4.3 | Adjust ontology and Effort/Value calibration based on findings | Feedback summary | Week 11 |
| 4.4 | Draft short academic paper or conference submission (“Brand Engineering as Cognitive Continuity”) | Brand Science + UPN docs | Week 12 |

**Milestone 4:**  
📍 *UPN v1.1 — Validated Framework* ready for public or internal publication.

---

### Optional Deliverables
- 📚 **Zettelkasten bundle:** automatic export of each persona and theory node as standalone `.md` Zettels.  
- 🧠 **Agent 13 plugin:** YAML ingestion to generate scenario simulations based on hats.  
- 📈 **CSR semantic visualiser:** SVG export of persona interconnections and effort/value loops.  

---

### 🧩 Governance & Ownership
- **Strategic steward:** Ricky Martin (Brand Science architect)  
- **Ontology maintainer:** Agent 13 / Docforge  
- **Implementation agent:** CSR + Crank-theme integration  
- **Academic liaison:** Future Crankbird Research group

**Concept:**  
A federated ecosystem of AI-consumable services, each wrapped in standardised governance (privacy, billing, audit, security).  
Agents discover and contract services through a machine-readable directory containing verifiable cost and trust metadata.  
Transactions settle via low-fee networks like Stellar, enabling fine-grained market mechanisms for autonomous cooperation.  
The governance envelope becomes the trust substrate — a constitution for machines.

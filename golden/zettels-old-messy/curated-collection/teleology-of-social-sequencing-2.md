summary: >
  Explains the theoretical and research foundations of conversational sequencing in social and business contexts.
  Draws on psychology, negotiation theory, and social neuroscience to show how staged structure—rapport → alignment → exploration → closure—
  increases trust, receptivity, and cooperative outcomes. Links these insights to Brand Science’s concept of teleological design.

### Conceptual Summary
The conversational arc of rapport, curiosity, exploration, and closure
follows a teleological sequence that optimises trust formation and persuasion.
Behavioural evidence from psychology and social neuroscience confirms that
predictable pacing reduces defensiveness and amplifies cooperative alignment.

  Hypothesises that XLM’s November 2024 price surge reflected institutional provisioning of lumens for transaction gas, potentially linked to Stripe’s expansion of USDC payout rails.

**Concept:**  
Stellar’s tokenomics tie real network usage directly to XLM demand.  
If a large fintech (e.g. Stripe) were preparing to launch Stellar-based stablecoin settlements, it would require large working reserves of lumens to activate accounts and cover gas.  
On-chain spikes in November 2024 suggest pre-provisioning consistent with that pattern — a reminder that *sometimes price moves are plumbing, not hype.*

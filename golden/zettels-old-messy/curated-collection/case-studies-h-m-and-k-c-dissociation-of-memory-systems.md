## Summary
Amnesic patients H.M. and K.C. provided the first concrete evidence separating **episodic** from **semantic** memory.
- **H.M.** (Scoville & Milner, 1957): loss of episodic memory after hippocampal removal, intact procedural and factual knowledge.
- **K.C.** (Tulving, 1989): could learn new facts but not recall personal experiences.

## Evidence Type
Neuropsychological case studies

## Key Sources
- Scoville & Milner (1957). *Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.* **J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry**, 20(1), 11–21.
- Tulving (1989). *Multiple memory systems and consciousness.* **Human Neurobiology**, 6(2), 67–80.

## Reflection
Episodic loss with preserved semantic function implies separate neural substrates. For **Brand Engineering**, this is analogous to when customers remember a *brand’s facts* but not *their own experiences*—knowledge without emotional context.

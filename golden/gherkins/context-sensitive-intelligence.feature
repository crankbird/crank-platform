Feature: Context-Sensitive Intelligence

  Scenario: Systems architect encounters abstraction leakage
    Given a theoretical framework that should work universally
    When practical implementation reveals contextual dependencies
    Then the AI should help explore contextual factors rather than force universal application

  Scenario: Field decision maker needs local judgment
    Given incomplete information and time pressure
    When headquarters guidelines don't account for local conditions
    Then the AI should support context-aware judgment rather than rigid rule application

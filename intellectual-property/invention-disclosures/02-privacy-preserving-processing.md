# Invention Disclosure: Privacy-Preserving Multi-Cloud AI Processing

**Invention Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Inventor(s)**: John R.  
**Application Domain**: Privacy-Preserving AI, Distributed Computing  

## Problem Statement
Organizations need to process sensitive data using AI services across multiple cloud providers, but existing solutions either expose sensitive data or require complex encryption schemes that limit AI processing capabilities.

## Technical Solution
A data sanitization and privacy-preserving system that enables secure AI processing across untrusted cloud environments while maintaining data utility and compliance requirements.

## Key Technical Components

### 1. Intelligent Data Sanitizer
```python
class DataSanitizer(MeshInterface):
    """Sanitizes sensitive data while preserving AI processing utility"""
    
    def sanitize_for_processing(self, data: Any, sensitivity_level: str) -> SanitizedData:
        # Apply appropriate sanitization strategy
        if sensitivity_level == "PII":
            return self.apply_differential_privacy(data)
        elif sensitivity_level == "FINANCIAL":
            return self.apply_homomorphic_encryption(data)
        elif sensitivity_level == "HEALTHCARE":
            return self.apply_federated_learning_prep(data)
        
    def restore_results(self, sanitized_results: Any, context: ProcessingContext) -> Any:
        # Restore meaningful results while maintaining privacy
        return self.context_aware_restoration(sanitized_results, context)
```

### 2. Context-Aware Privacy Preservation
- Dynamic privacy level adjustment based on data classification
- Utility-preserving anonymization techniques
- Reversible sanitization for authorized result reconstruction
- Multi-level privacy guarantees (k-anonymity, differential privacy, etc.)

### 3. Distributed Trust Management
- Zero-knowledge proof verification for cloud provider compliance
- Secure multi-party computation for sensitive aggregations
- Attestation-based trust establishment
- Cryptographic audit trails

## Novel Aspects
1. **First system to provide utility-preserving data sanitization for multi-cloud AI**
2. **Novel combination of multiple privacy-preserving techniques based on data sensitivity**
3. **Context-aware result restoration maintaining privacy guarantees**
4. **Distributed trust management for untrusted cloud environments**

## Commercial Applications
- Healthcare AI requiring HIPAA compliance across multiple clouds
- Financial services with PCI-DSS requirements
- Government agencies with classified data processing needs
- Enterprise AI with trade secret protection requirements

## Competitive Advantages
- Enables secure AI processing on untrusted cloud infrastructure
- Maintains data utility while ensuring privacy compliance
- Provides granular privacy controls based on data sensitivity
- Enables global AI deployment without data exposure risks

## Prior Art Differentiation
Unlike existing solutions that focus on either full encryption (limiting AI processing) or basic anonymization (insufficient for sensitive data), this invention provides:
- Context-aware privacy preservation
- Utility-optimized sanitization strategies
- Multi-level privacy guarantees
- Reversible privacy protection with authorization controls

## Implementation Status
- Privacy strategy framework: Planned
- Data sanitization service: In development
- Trust management system: Planned
- Result restoration mechanisms: Planned

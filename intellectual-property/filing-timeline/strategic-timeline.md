# Patent Filing Timeline & Strategy

**Strategic Filing Schedule for Crank Platform IP Portfolio**

## Phase 1: Provisional Patent Applications (November 2025)
**Budget: ~$400 AUD per application**

### Priority 1 - Sovereign GPU Orchestration
- **Filing Date**: November 15, 2025
- **Rationale**: Core innovation with clear commercial value
- **Scope**: Data sovereignty routing, compliance-driven compute placement
- **Implementation Status**: Foundation complete, enhancement in progress

### Priority 2 - Privacy-Preserving Multi-Cloud AI
- **Filing Date**: November 30, 2025  
- **Rationale**: Strong defensive patent potential
- **Scope**: Data sanitization, context-aware privacy preservation
- **Implementation Status**: Framework planned, technical feasibility validated

### Priority 3 - Cryptocurrency Settlement for AI Compute
- **Filing Date**: December 15, 2025
- **Rationale**: Novel intersection of blockchain and AI services
- **Scope**: Performance-based settlements, compliance automation
- **Implementation Status**: Stellar integration planned, smart contracts in development

## Phase 2: Prior Art Analysis & Claim Refinement (December 2025 - February 2026)
**Budget: ~$500 AUD (self-conducted research)**

### Week 1-2: Comprehensive Prior Art Search
- Patent database searches (Google Patents, USPTO, WIPO)
- Academic literature review (IEEE, ACM Digital Library)
- Commercial product analysis (AWS, Azure, GCP offerings)
- Open source project analysis (Kubernetes, OpenStack, etc.)

### Week 3-4: Competitive Landscape Mapping
- Identify key players in multi-cloud orchestration
- Analyze existing data sovereignty solutions
- Review blockchain payment systems for cloud services
- Document differentiation opportunities

### Week 5-8: Claim Development & Refinement
- Draft detailed patent claims for each invention
- Conduct freedom-to-operate analysis
- Refine invention scope based on prior art findings
- Prepare defensive publication strategies for non-core innovations

## Phase 3: Standard Patent Applications (March 2026)
**Budget: ~$370 AUD per application + $490 examination**

### Filing Strategy
- Convert strongest provisional applications to standard applications
- Focus on method patents rather than system patents for broader protection
- Include continuation applications for related innovations
- File PCT applications for international protection (if budget allows)

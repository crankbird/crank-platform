# Intellectual Property Portfolio

## Overview
This directory contains patent applications, prior art research, and IP strategy documentation for the Crank Platform's novel innovations in multi-cloud AI orchestration, data sovereignty, and cryptocurrency settlement.

## Key Innovations Identified
1. **Sovereign-Aware GPU Orchestration**: Compliance-driven compute placement across cloud providers
2. **Multi-Cloud Cost Analytics with Crypto Settlement**: Real-time pricing analysis with Stellar XLM payments
3. **Privacy-Preserving Multi-Cloud AI**: Data sanitization and jurisdiction-aware processing
4. **Security-First Mesh Interface**: Universal pattern for secure distributed AI services

## Filing Strategy
- Start with provisional patents for core innovations (~$400 AUD total)
- File PCT applications within 12 months if validation successful
- Focus on method patents rather than system patents for broader protection

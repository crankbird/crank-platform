# Copilot Context Security - Critical Guidelines

# ⚠️ NEVER PUT COPILOT CONVERSATION CONTEXT IN GIT!

# VS Code / GitHub Copilot conversation context
.vscode-server/
**/*copilot-chat*
**/*conversation*
**/*chat-history*
**/copilot-chat/

# ✅ Exception: IP documentation files with 'copilot' in name are SAFE
# These are sanitized documentation, not raw conversation context:
# intellectual-property/copilot-context.md (SAFE)

# Sensitive backup files (UNENCRYPTED ONLY)
**/ip-context-*.tar.gz
**/copilot-backup-*
**/*conversation-backup*

# ✅ ENCRYPTED backups are SAFE (these are allowed):
# intellectual-property/encrypted-backups/*.gpg

# Patent development working files (before review)
**/patent-drafts-working/
**/prior-art-raw/
**/brainstorming-sessions/

# Commercial sensitive data
**/customer-validation-raw/
**/pricing-analysis-internal/
**/competitive-intelligence/

# Personal notes and unfiltered thoughts
**/personal-notes/
**/strategy-thoughts/
**/unfiltered-analysis/

# Decryption passwords and keys
**/*password*
**/*passphrase*
**/private-keys/

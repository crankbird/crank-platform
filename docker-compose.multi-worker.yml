# Platform + Multi-Worker Architecture
# 
# This docker-compose sets up:
# - Platform service (PaaS layer) with auth, billing, discovery, routing  
# - CrankDoc worker (document conversion)
# - CrankEmail worker (ML email classification)
# - Proper networking for service discovery
# - Zero-trust mTLS security for all services

services:
